This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, vulnerable to crashes if an invalid user ID is provided. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Express.js applications to prevent unexpected behavior and maintain application stability.
